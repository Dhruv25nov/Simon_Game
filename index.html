    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <div class="content">
        <p>1️⃣The game will start with a random sequence of colors, chosen by the game's computer.</p>
        <p>2️⃣The computer will blink up the first color in the sequence.</p>
        <p>3️⃣The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding color button.
            If the player gets the sequence correct, the computer will add one more color to
            the sequence and play it back for the player.
        </p>
        <p>4️⃣The player must then repeat the longer sequence correctly, starting from the beginning.</p>
        <p>5️⃣The game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong color button.</p>
        <p>6️⃣If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.</p>
        <p>7️⃣The player can then choose to play again and try to beat their previous score.</p>
